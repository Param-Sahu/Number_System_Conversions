# Number_System_Conversions
- In Digital Electronics I read about Number System . In Number System basically there are 4 base of a number : Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal.</br>
- This C++ program convert decimal to binary , binary to octal , octal to hexadecimal etc.  This program can do all conversions of Binary , Octal , Decimal and Hexadecimal.
- I created this program to test my coding skills as well as easy conversions of numbers.
- This program works for positive integers only, not for floating numbers.
- This program is not suitable for very large numbers because in C++ variables are dependent on data type and predefined maximum value size.
- I know there are many advanced converters available online , but as a student making this program was very exciting for me.
- While creating this Program, I learned about control statements like if-else and switch-cases , Use of Global Variables , Loops , Function and Recursion in C++.
